    <p class="learn-more-description">
      Our data science project focuses on weather prediction and risk assessment in Cambodia. By analyzing historical and real-time data, we aim to provide actionable forecasts that help mitigate potential risks in various sectors.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p class="learn-more-description">
      We collect data from weather stations, satellite imagery, and real-time weather data sources. Our machine learning models analyze this information to predict severe weather patterns and assess risks such as flooding or droughts. The goal is to offer precise predictions that help local businesses and farmers prepare for the worst.
    </p>

    <h3>Real-World Web Applications</h3>
    <p class="learn-more-description">
      The insights generated from our project can aid agricultural planning, resource management, and disaster preparedness in Cambodia. Farmers can plan their crops better, businesses can manage supply chain disruptions, and local governments can prepare for climate-related events.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p class="learn-more-description">
      Moving forward, we aim to improve the accuracy of our forecasts by incorporating more data sources and refining our models. Our long-term goal is to create a comprehensive weather and risk prediction system that can be used across Southeast Asia.
    </p>

    <h3>Get Involved</h3>
